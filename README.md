Introduction: Introduction: Jammify is an interactive music experience where users can explore different songs and control their playback speed in real-time. Clicking on a preselected song, users can listen to it and adjust its speed, making it slower or faster according to their preference. Whether you're looking to enjoy a relaxing, slow tempo or speed things up for a fun twist, Jammify allows you to easily personalise your listening experience. It's a fun and engaging way to explore music.
